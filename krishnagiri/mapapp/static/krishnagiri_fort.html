    <h1 align="center">krishnagiri Fort</h1>
    <p><b>The fort and its surroundings were commonly referred to as "Baramahal," a term that linguistically translates to "twelve forts." This nomenclature reflects the presence of twelve hilltop forts in the region, including Krishnagiri Fort. This majestic fort was built under the aegis of the Vijayanagara Empire.[1][2]

        Jagadevarayar-I, a prominent chief of the Vijayanagara Empire, undertook a strategic migration from Hyderabad to Penukonda. Renowned for his exemplary valor, he played a crucial role in confronting and defeating the forces of the Bijapur army. The extraordinary bravery displayed by Jagadevarayar-I caught the attention of Ranga Raya-II, a representative of the Vijayanagara Empire stationed at Chandragiri.[2][3]</b></p>
